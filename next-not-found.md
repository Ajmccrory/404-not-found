404 error page
 
the challenge is to make an error page that turns a moment of frustration into a moment of
beauty of creativity and innovation. I would like for mine to be something reminciscent of rick
and morty. The color themes of the page should mimic the blues and greens of rick and morty as well as the cosmic black hole type of thing that is in the title sequence of the show.

Component wise I want this to be a next.js page that is run statically without a backend. so the entire next js app is just the 404 not found error page. Be as creative as possible with the style and interactivity of the page.
