# Rick and Morty 404 Portal Page

A creative and interactive 404 error page inspired by Rick and Morty's portal animations. I got bored and wanted to make a 404 not found page with a rick and morty theme but couldn't find the fonts I wanted.

## Features

- Interactive portal that follows mouse movement
- Multiple background portals with random positions and animations
- Portal explosion effects when clicking the return button
- Authentic Rick and Morty styling with the "Get Schwifty" font
- GSAP animations for smooth, professional motion
- Fully responsive design
- Custom glow effects and animations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
